### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

- the network call and design as well as caching of the images and the unit tests. I focused mainly on the caching of images and unit tests because they were both something that I have not done much of. I have never cached images without a third party sdk so that was a fun learning experience, and then writing the tests for the caching as well as the network call were also something that I do not have that much exerience with so it was really cool to learn some new things that I can use in the future. The network call was pretty straightforward, but again writing the tests for it were something new which was fun. 

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

- initial setup - 1 hour
- ui and design - 2 hours
- caching images and minor design updates - 1 hour
- fixing caching images - 1 hour
- minor design updates and functionality - 1 hour
- testing, qa, and writing tests - 3-4 hours
- final qa and minor fixes - 1 hour

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

- the only tradeoffs I can really think of were from a design aspect. I am used to uiKit and am still learning swiftUI so there are some ui things that I do not know how to do yet or can do in a much better way. Also I am used to being given a design to follow and build so freestyling took a little longer than I would have liked in terms of what should go where and how to make the app look nice without spending too much time on design and ux.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

- The ui and design, I am much more versed in uikit and am still learning swiftUI, in particular things that uiKit has but swiftUI does not per say, like table views or collection views in uiKit are lists or grids in swiftUI and are handled in different ways that I have to learn and get used to. I also mentioned this above, but I am used to being given a design to follow ie sketch or figma so creating the design took a little longer than expected. 

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered

- i really did enjoy this project. It was really simple and easy from a general concept, but once I started getting into some of the "nitty-gritty" it got a little more challenging in some aspects and also I learned a lot of new things and got to practice a little with swiftUI as well. Thank you for the opportunity and I look forward to next steps!
